# Physics Based Character Controller
Based on the approach devised by the [Toyful Games](https://www.toyfulgames.com/) team for [Very Very Valet](https://www.toyfulgames.com/very-very-valet). In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdskE8PJy6Q&ab_channel=ToyfulGames) from the team's development blog, the various techniques for the movement are outlined and explained. The video also provides snippets of code, though incomplete in places. The source code was not provided by Toyful Games due to it being tied up in the complex otherworkings of Very Very Valet. This project is aimed at being an independent pure re-creation of the physics based character controller.

Contributions big and small from all are welcome and encouraged!
